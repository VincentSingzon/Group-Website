<h2> Autonomous Cars </h2>
<br>
<h3> What Does it Do? </h3>
<br>
<span> This technology is mainly still under development in most areas. While cars are not yet fully autonomous for public use, many cars have autonomous features such as automatic or driver-assisted parking and even an intelligent cruise control system that will adjust to the changing traffic conditions of the road. These systems are the first steps towards a fully autonomous car in the future and a lot of the pieces of an autonomous car exist, however, they need to be fully assembled to make a proper car that can drive itself. Even technologies such as the car knowing when it needs fuel, where it needs to go and when the tyre pressure becomes too low for the car to operate safely have been developed. Autonomous cars can be classed into 6 different categories, from fully human operated at level 0, to fully autonomous at level 5. Level 1 cars allow the car to preform 1 autonomous task at a time. These tasks include automatic lane keeping or automatic cruise control and require a driver. Level 2 cars can perform 2 autonomous tasks at any given time including steering and automatic braking, or cruise control. The driver must still be in control of a level 2 car. Level 3  cars will be self-driving under good conditions and inside of certain areas known as geofenced areas. Level 3 cars still require a driver to take over if the car is no longer able to drive itself. Level 4 cars are full autonomous under certain road conditions such as weather, terrain and speed. If the conditions become too poor for the car, the driver must take over. Level 5 cars allow full control to the car and no driver being needed. While dealers such as Audi and Tesla have achieved level 3 automatic cars, there are no available cars with automatic capacity greater than 3, with no cars in categories 4 or 5. Despite this, Google,  Zoox and Tesla are working towards a fully automatic car in the near future. Zoox is leading this charge, with their company being full devoted to the goal of making a level 5 driverless car. As previously mentioned, a lot of the technologies for a fully driverless car already exist today and have been properly implemented into the cars. There are very few new technologies that need to be developed in order for driverless cars to work, besides the removal of the need for the geofences that allow today’s automated cars to operate. The technologies that may be needed include better 3D mapping software to allow cars to track hazards more effectively and to track the terrain that they are currently operating on. Cameras which have a night mode, such as Apple’s new IPhone 11 camera could also help to detect terrain under dark conditions such as night or during storms. In the next 3 years, this technology may be applied to the driverless cars of today, to make them full autonomous under any conditions. We may possibly even see networks of interconnected cars that communicate with each other to make the roads a safer place to drive. Driverless cars are here, and in the near future we could be seeing many more of them on our roads, with technology for them being reapplied in new ways.</span>

<h3> What is the Likely Impact? </h3>
<span>There is a drastic impact to be had from this technology. With cars finally becoming driverless, it eliminates human error from the road. Driving under the influence of drugs or when tired would be eliminated, since nobody would be driving anymore. These factors being eliminated would make it much safer for people to be on the roads. Travel times may also decrease, with computers needing less time to make decisions than a human would, meaning corners could be taken faster, cars would need less than a three second gap between them, traffic conditions would be automatically mapped so the computer would take the fastest route, and many more improvements to the roads. Everybody is most affected by this change. Most people in the world today, and especially in Australia, own a private car, and the ability to make your car driverless would mean that people have more time when they travel to work every day to do things other than drive. Court cases involving driving accidents would be drastically reduced in time and number, since the cars would constantly monitor their surroundings and everything would likely be recorded. With cameras, police would easily be able to see exactly what happened to cause a crash. The one downside of the driverless cars is the people who make a living off of driving. This could include taxi drivers, bus drivers or others. It’s not just the people who drive for a living that could be made redundant, traffic police may also lose their jobs, or have those jobs reduced in number, since they wouldn’t have to preform RBTs, check cases of speeding and running red lights, and check for cases of using a phone while driving. There could be new jobs opening in the development of this technology, as more dealerships move towards driverless cars.
