<p>When I’m working in a team, my behaviour will be influenced in a contradicting way. This is because I have an introverted personality, but I also have a need to be in control. This means that while working with people I don’t know, I will have a need to convey my ideas, but will have no way to actually convey them because I am too introverted and I can’t do it efficiently or confidently. I should also consider that I become distracted easily, but am quick to get back to work. If I am not able to fidget or do something while I work, then I may not be able to concentrate on the work. Because of this, I should consider my likelihood of either become agitated or distracted in a group situation. I should strongly consider my ability to not see other people’s solutions as well, since I can get caught up in planning my own solution to a problem and then push this idea, instead of listening to other people’s solutions.</p>

<p>These results are very influential for my participation and behaviour in a team. I now know that I have to work harder to emotionally connect with people that I am in a team with. This is from the 16 personalities test. Since I have a highly logical mind, from the 16 personality test again, that I be assigned to tasks that require logical thinking. If I need to learn things while in the team, then I also need to use visual techniques to do so.

<h2 id="ideal">Ideal Jobs</h2>
<h3> Vincent Singzon </h3>
<span> My Ideal job was Cyber Security Engineer The common element I found in this was the relations to IT field. The thing which differentiates my position from others is protecting damage to hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.  My career plan is similar to others in how we apply things from IT to our work
</span>
<h3> Keetan Southwell </h3>
<span >My ideal job was as a civil engineering project manager. The common elements I found in this job are the impacts that IT has on it, in that the job is drastically assisted by IT. It is different in the sense that it is not specifically in the IT field of work. My career plan is very different to others in the group. </span>
<h3> Will Grime </h3>
<span> My ideal job was to be a junior data scientist. The common elements I found in the jobe was the use of IT to complete the job, as in the use of coding languages such as R and Python. The difference of this job was that it was largely about the use of data and maths to help businesses in real time. My career plan is similar to others in that I want to complete University, and then get different jobs to obtain the skillset I would need.</span>

<p> The GitHub trail doesn't entirely reflect the work and planning that has gone in to this assignment. Our group used other tools such as the discussion forums via Canvas, a shared google doc and discord to communicate our ideas for this project. GitHub was worked on last out of most of these tools, with planning being done though other means. Thus, GitHub doesn't accuratley reflect our group's work patterns.</p>

<h3> Demand Ranking </h3>
<p> Systems Administrator - Kyle Molloy</p>
<p>The rest of our ideal jobs are not listed on the burning glass data.</p>
<h3>Required Skillset</h3>
<p>Because our ideal jobs for our group were so varied, some being in the IT field, others not and some being in between these two, we were unable to come up with one set of ideal skills required for our group. This does, however, add more diversity to the group and makes our team stronger, since we all have different skills.</p>

<h3> Vincent Singzon </h3>
<span>My ideal Job cyber security anaylst is in large demand as their is currently a shortage of skills related to cybersecurity that cost Australia $400 million in lost revenue the skills required for the role would be IT skills like programming, networking communication and presentation skills, problem solving. The three highest ranked IT specific skills that are not required skillset are 
Business Management, Business process and Building relationships. The three skills not in my skillset are Python, Graphic design and Javascript.<span>
<h3> Will Grime </h3>
<span>My job of juniour data scientist, which probably has a moderate to large demand from employers. The technical skill that is needed, Python, is not in great demand from employers. However, communication and presentation skills along with problem solving skills are the top two non specific skills in terms of demand. The three highest ranked IT skills that aren't required for my job are SQL, Javascript and Java. The three highest ranked non IT skills that aren't required for my job are organisational skills, writing, and teamwork/collaboration. After looking at the burning glass data, my opinion of my ideal job hasn't changed much. It has changed to also include skills that are in great demand. This is because I want a job where the skills can be helpful to get more jobs and can be applied in other areas.</span>
<h3> Keetan Southwell</h3>
<span> The skill of project management in my ideal job ranks fifth in the list of desired skill by employers. The general skills that are required in my ideal field rank among the top, with communication, problem solving and organisation being the top three skill respectively and teamwork and planning also being ranked highly on the list. The three highest ranked IT specific skill that are not in my required skillset are SQL, JavaScript and JAVA, which are the three highest ranking skills. All of the generic skills need to be had in any job to make a person successful, however the least useful ones in my required skillset for a project management job would be creativity, presentation skills and self-starter. Having looked at the burning glass data has not changed my ideal job, since it is not in the IT field to begin with and the burning glass data is geared specifically towards IT careers.</span>

<h2 id="it">IT Work</h2>
<h3>Professional Interview</h3>
<br>
<span> The IT professional we interviewed is in the business of telecommunications. He does software, firmware and hardware testing, as well as project management in the telecommunications field. He interacts daily with the company management, software and hardware engineers, software testers, documentation workers and customer tech support. He mainly spent his time at work at a desk or in testing labs in an office building. The hardest part of his job was said to be the making judgement calls on whether or not to ship a certain project and making decisions about the readiness of certain projects for customer consumption. He said this was the ardest part because if he made the wrong decision, it could come back on him from his supervisors in either case, where a product was shipped too early or too late.</span>
<h2 id="IT">IT Technologies</h2>
<h3> Autonomous Cars </h3>
<br>
<h3> What Does it Do? </h3>
<span> This technology is mainly still under development in most areas. While cars are not yet fully autonomous for public use, many cars have autonomous features such as automatic or driver-assisted parking and even an intelligent cruise control system that will adjust to the changing traffic conditions of the road. These systems are the first steps towards a fully autonomous car in the future and a lot of the pieces of an autonomous car exist, however, they need to be fully assembled to make a proper car that can drive itself. Even technologies such as the car knowing when it needs fuel, where it needs to go and when the tyre pressure becomes too low for the car to operate safely have been developed. Autonomous cars can be classed into 6 different categories, from fully human operated at level 0, to fully autonomous at level 5. Level 1 cars allow the car to preform 1 autonomous task at a time. These tasks include automatic lane keeping or automatic cruise control and require a driver. Level 2 cars can perform 2 autonomous tasks at any given time including steering and automatic braking, or cruise control. The driver must still be in control of a level 2 car. Level 3  cars will be self-driving under good conditions and inside of certain areas known as geofenced areas. Level 3 cars still require a driver to take over if the car is no longer able to drive itself. Level 4 cars are full autonomous under certain road conditions such as weather, terrain and speed. If the conditions become too poor for the car, the driver must take over. Level 5 cars allow full control to the car and no driver being needed. While dealers such as Audi and Tesla have achieved level 3 automatic cars, there are no available cars with automatic capacity greater than 3, with no cars in categories 4 or 5. Despite this, Google,  Zoox and Tesla are working towards a fully automatic car in the near future. Zoox is leading this charge, with their company being full devoted to the goal of making a level 5 driverless car. As previously mentioned, a lot of the technologies for a fully driverless car already exist today and have been properly implemented into the cars. There are very few new technologies that need to be developed in order for driverless cars to work, besides the removal of the need for the geofences that allow today’s automated cars to operate. The technologies that may be needed include better 3D mapping software to allow cars to track hazards more effectively and to track the terrain that they are currently operating on. Cameras which have a night mode, such as Apple’s new IPhone 11 camera could also help to detect terrain under dark conditions such as night or during storms. In the next 3 years, this technology may be applied to the driverless cars of today, to make them full autonomous under any conditions. We may possibly even see networks of interconnected cars that communicate with each other to make the roads a safer place to drive. Driverless cars are here, and in the near future we could be seeing many more of them on our roads, with technology for them being reapplied in new ways.</span>
<br>
<h3> What is the Likely Impact? </h3>
<span>There is a drastic impact to be had from this technology. With cars finally becoming driverless, it eliminates human error from the road. Driving under the influence of drugs or when tired would be eliminated, since nobody would be driving anymore. These factors being eliminated would make it much safer for people to be on the roads. Travel times may also decrease, with computers needing less time to make decisions than a human would, meaning corners could be taken faster, cars would need less than a three second gap between them, traffic conditions would be automatically mapped so the computer would take the fastest route, and many more improvements to the roads. Everybody is most affected by this change. Most people in the world today, and especially in Australia, own a private car, and the ability to make your car driverless would mean that people have more time when they travel to work every day to do things other than drive. Court cases involving driving accidents would be drastically reduced in time and number, since the cars would constantly monitor their surroundings and everything would likely be recorded. With cameras, police would easily be able to see exactly what happened to cause a crash. The one downside of the driverless cars is the people who make a living off of driving. This could include taxi drivers, bus drivers or others. It’s not just the people who drive for a living that could be made redundant, traffic police may also lose their jobs, or have those jobs reduced in number, since they wouldn’t have to preform RBTs, check cases of speeding and running red lights, and check for cases of using a phone while driving. There could be new jobs opening in the development of this technology, as more dealerships move towards driverless cars.</span>
<br>
<h3> How Will This Affect Us? </h3>
<span> This may affect us in drastically different ways. Some families may do a lot of driving, my father is always incredibly tired at the end of the day, since he spends most of his day driving around. This would help him to not be as tired at the end of the day and fulfil his main day job of renovating our house. It would allow me personally, to travel to a friend’s house easier and without the need for my parents to drive me, since I still only have a learner’s licence. Overall, autonomous cars would have a large impact on us and the people around us, however the variation in these impacts would be limited. There is little personal impact to be had from this new technology as everyone is mostly affected in the same ways, having faster and better transport that is also more efficient.</span>
<br>
<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
<br>
<h3>what does Cybersecurity do</h3>
<span>Cyber Security is the protection of computer systems from theft or damage to it's hardware, software and electronic data. The field is becomnig more important due to increased use of computers systems, the internet, wireless technologies such as wifi and bluetooth and the increased use of smart devices such as smartphones. To protect systems Cybersecurity uses vendors
Vendors in cybersecurity would use endpoint, network and advanced threat protection security as well as data loss prevention. Three commonly known cybersecurity vendors include Cisco, McAfee and Trend Micro. Cisco focuses on networking and allows customers to utilize firewalls, vpn and advanced malware protection along with supporting email and endpoint security and  also realtime malware blocking. Mcafee makes cybersecurity products for consumers and enterprise users, it supports mobile, enterprise cloud, network, web and server-based security also offering data protection and encryption Trend Micro is an anti-malware vendor which offers threat protection for mobile, hybrid clouds, SaaS and the IoT. Trend Micro provides users with endpoint, email and web security. what is likely to be done soon as a reponse to increased cyber security threat is New job title appearing such as (CCO chief cybercrime officer).
<br>
<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
  <span>As people are being exposed more to technology like smartphones and computers there is a greater emphases on protecting users from cyberattacks such as computer viruses, date breaches and denial of service attacks. What is likely to change in the future is the increased need to protect computer systems as they can be a big deal, able to cuase things such as blackouts, stealing personal information, and breach of security like military equipment and disruption of computer systems and phone services. The people who will most likely effect would be anyone who uses technology in their daily lives. This field will create new jobs in the future as it is a growing field and buisness and government wanting to hire people specialized in this field. New titles appearing such as cybercrime officer. </span>
<h3>What does it do</h3>
<span>This will affect me as a lot of my life revolves around technology, it will affect everyone as well as we rely on technology in our daily lives. What will be different is that cyber criminals are able to target things such as medical technologies like pacemakers, hack into military installations stealing sensitive data and have terrorists disrupt power grids or phone lines and as the world becomes more digital we need people who are able to protect consumers and business from cyber threats. </span>

<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<br>
<h3>What does it do</h3>
<span>Machine learning is the ability of machines, robots, and computer programs to use data to learn. It essentially uses data to improve the reliability, usefulness and accuracy of computer programs. Machine learning is often interchanged with artificial intelligence, however, artificial intelligence is where computers are given human characteristics, and machine learning is the method that the computer uses to do this. Machine learning uses large, diverse, complex data sets and analyses it, learning from it, identifying patterns and making decisions based on the data. This data could be the surroundings of the computer, and be analysing it as it comes in, for example autonomous vehicles. The data could also be from the past, such as a chess machine analysing how chess masters have played in the past. To conclude, machine learning is the analysis of data by a computer to improve a computer.
<br><br>
There are currently many different areas of machine learning, such that there isn’t really one ‘state of the art’ of this technology. Machine learning can be seen in almost all areas of society. This includes anywhere from google, to autonomous cars, to stock analysis. This technology also isn’t that new. The first Machine learning started in the early 1950’s, with computers being able to convince humans that they were human, and a program of checkers that learnt as it ran. The current state of the art for one part of machine learning is probably google’s search algorithms, and various other algorithms that have ‘suggested’ items. Another state of the art part of machine learning would be autonomous cars, Siri and similar chatterbots, and the code in humanoid robots such as the Honda ASIMO. To sum up, there are various state of the art machine learning technologies.
<br><br>
At the moment, machine learning can analyse data, come up with solutions to problems, help customise user experience, and assist in autonomous vehicles and systems. It can currently customise user experience, such as in youtube’s ‘suggested’ videos, or google’s autofill. It is also used in autonomous cars to get data from all cars and share it to other cars, thus enabling learning from one car to be passed to others. Machine learning in chess programs can also learn a particular players’ playing style and adapt its strategy to play against them. 
<br><br>
Over the next three years, machine learning will hopefully keep improving. However it is unlikely that it will reach the levels seen in sci fi movies and TV. It is likely going to be able to win very complex games such as chess go, however it is unlikely to be able to be able to maintain a house. Machine learning will probably greatly improve in chat bots, as more data will be coming in that will be able to help the programs. Autonomous cars are likely to be completely road safe, however whether they will be legal or not is a different question. The technological advancements that has made machine learning possible is the complex algorithms that have been developed to recognise patterns, make decisions, and to learn without human intervention. Another technology that has greatly helped is the development of systems that can produce large quantities of data, such as sensors, and the internet. This has enabled machine learning to use this data to improve itself.
